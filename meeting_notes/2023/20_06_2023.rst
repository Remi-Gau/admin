    - Yasmin will work on the surface loader
        - Leave CoordinateImage API for now but try to stay consistent
- ancp-bids / PyBIDS proposal https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids/issues/989
  - improve documentation on what our current BIDS handling functions do and do not do
  - not necessarily urgent; we have "stop-gap" code that we have been using for a couple of years
  - long term goal is to delegate BIDS handling to an external library
  - feed back on RFC what exactly we're using in the library right now

- internal communication:
    - "core devs" channel on our discord server
    - make all core devs admin of the server
- fixed date for yearly major release: January - **Discuss again next meeting**
  - goal:
    - help us plan / organize

      (deprecation warnings send to a "roadmap" page)
