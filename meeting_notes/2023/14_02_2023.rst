General points
--------------

- How would folks feel about a 0.10.1rc1 release soon?
    - Alternatively, has anyone considered using a tool like `auto <https://github.com/intuit/auto>`_? I (TS) think it would be useful to make patch releases whenever a bug is fixed.
    - JD: There are good reasons to release fairly infrequently, so we don't want to make frequent patch releases.
    - We could have frequent pre-releases instead, so regular users won't deal with a lot of versions, but folks who need a specific bug-fix can pin to a release candidate.
    - Aim for once a month pre-releases, keeping current cadence of one non-pre-release every ~6mo
- Reformatting codebase with black
    - Line length (current is flake8 default of 79)
        - Readability might not improve even with longer line length
        - Not many lines' readability is affected
        - Keep as is
    - Where to put parameter default value in docstrings (See `comment <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/3491#issuecomment-1427666952>`_)
        - We need to ask Remi how the type annotation extraction tool (if there is one) would work.
        - Including the default value in the type description portion of the argument's docstring is numpydoc style, so this is probably a change we want to make even if we don't adopt type hinting.
    - Other?
- NiiVue progress
    - At the point that we can succesfully use niivue methods to load base64 encoded data and view in browser using html embedding
- Replacing `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` with `pyproject.toml`

    - http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2021-transition-to-pyproject.toml-example.html
    - Jerome will configure `pyproject.toml` based on what Chris did and test it on testpypi
