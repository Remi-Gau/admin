General points
--------------

- CZI position
    - Already had one interview
    - Start sending out posting through various channels this week
        - See draft: overleaf.com/3674263154gyndmhhjpngh
- Issues with Neurostars platform
    - We don't have a template. This is a feature supported by Discourse, but not actually used in Neurostars.
    - Can't monitor posts. Neurostars doesn't have any admins moderating posts (e.g., asking folks to open a new topic when their topic has meandered away from the original question).
    - There will be costs to switching platforms, so will focus on improving Neurostars first.
    - ACTION ITEM: Will reach out to INCF about our concerns and requests
- Office hours format
    - Adding a monthly meeting for Asia Pacific time zone
        - Send email to figure out a date and time
        - Do more extensive advertising beforehand
    - Having an agenda - limit to one item for discussion
    - Renaming "office hours" to "drop-in hours"?
