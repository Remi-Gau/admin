General points
--------------

- Release milestones
    - https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/milestone/24
    - surface code out of experimental, so that using glm does not trigger the issue
    - taking Surface out of experimental
        - no feedback on it but we did not have any explicit "useful" feature
        - wait for more feedback and feature until we are confident ?
        - or merge "soon" (before the release) the GLM surface PR and take the new Surface feature out of experimental ?
        - few people use surface for GLM so we may not get a lot of "signal" from them
        - DECISION: do not take a decision today but let's take a decision soon (before Xmas)


- Update on surface API
    - https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4027
    - https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4126 (need review)
    - What else is needed?
        - examples?
        - visualizations?
            - Forcing 'left' and 'right' keys
    - Comments on Chris M. comments


> I would be interested in your takes on https://github.com/nipy/nibabel/pull/1257. Since last I posted, the Pointset base class was merged, but TriangularMeshes having two arrays and possibly a family of associated coordinates feels a bit trickier to get right. With your experiences with your own structures, I want to know if the proposed class looks like it would be easy/difficult to work with, or what tests you'd want to see to make that determination.

CZI EOSSS 2022 - GLM
--------------------

Kanban board of TODOs from the CZI EOSSS grant

https://github.com/orgs/nilearn/projects/11/views/2?pane=issue&itemId=46168608


Relating to GLM performance:
============================

- one bottleneck seems to be the masking step
    - better benchmark / profiling could help
    - https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3398
    - https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3399 
- possible optimization: pre-compute 
- improve documentation with a page of tips regarding large scale analysis
    - Hao-Ting and members of lab have some pointers on this
