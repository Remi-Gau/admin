General points
--------------

- CZI application accepted
    - Ideally constrain position to Montreal but can consider other options (e.g. consulting)
    - Make a posting to push through our networks
        - Edit community-oriented posting here : https://www.overleaf.com/3674263154gyndmhhjpngh
        - First pass at places to advertise the posting :
            - https://github.com/nilearn/dev-days-2020/issues/9
            - https://github.com/nilearn/dev-days-2021/issues/5
    - Update previous McGill Seb position
        - Relevant information from Seb for creating posting for McGill:
            - the McGill position has to match the applicant experience pretty closely, hiring an applicant on a specific profile has to be justified and approved by admin (who I don't know).

            - the roles we were told would fit for our original call (pretty senior dev) were, in order of seniority:
                - IST2R
                - IST3S
                - IST3R
- Major release and setting milestones
    - Yasmin will start setting milestones
- New documentation theme
    - Dev/stable banner is gone
        - Look into making a way to toggle between two (open an issue)
    - News section is gone, do we want it back?
        - Update maintenance doc to take out news sections update instructions
    - Update what's new to changelog? Decision: no, keep the same
- Reorganizing website (see `comment <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/3125#issuecomment-1196040759>`_)
    - Think about our audience
        - CS or neuro background (or both)
    - Restructuring user guide
        - Reodering topics so order is more logical (start here)
    - Cleaning and organization of examples
        - e.g. see discussion in issue `2283 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2283>`_ about deprecating some fetchers
        - Can we get analytics data on examples? (Yasmin)
            - Alexis suggested https://matomo.org/pricing/?menu
    - Which topics/sections should be prominent and which can be buried or removed
    - See if we can get inspiration from https://psy3018.github.io/cartes_cerebrales.html (eliz : but try to be careful about keeping content in scope)
- Discussion with Chris about surface data support
    - See `Coordinate Image API <https://nipy.org/nibabel/devel/biaps/biap_0009.html>`_
    - Also nibabel PR `#1090 <https://github.com/nipy/nibabel/pull/1090>`_
    - This will take a long time to finish, shall we move on with our own implementation?
    - Jerome: If we want to move forward with nilearn Surface object we need to rethink its structure
    - Plan a brainstorm session to discuss further
- Alexis: possibility of plotting several contrast maps on a surface (open an issue)
