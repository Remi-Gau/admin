- Current issues

    - Correlation-base MVPA follow-up after last office hours (`#2742 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2742>`_).
        - `BrainIAK RSA<https://brainiak.org/tutorials/06-rsa/>`_.
        - TODO : Close issue
        - Optionally follow up with _BrainIAK_ and/or _PyRSA_ teams about aligning their approaches with _nilearn_ more.
    
    - Decoder cross-validation issue `#2883 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2883>`_, `#2886 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2886>`_.
      - Advise users not to perform parameter selection/grid search with imaging data? Low statistical power, parameter selection is noisy process with high chance of overfitting. Do model averaging.
      - Make sure that the thing runs using a GridSearchCV classifier
      - Fix example and documentation so it's clear that there is no nested CV implemented/possible within Decoder.

- Current PRs

    - Contributing docs PR `#2755 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/2755>`_ (stalled, can we help you @thomas?)
        - Please check out the recent build artifacts to see the issue with table rendering.
    
    - Deprecate surface functions API PR `#2682 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/2682>`_. Should we merge?
        - Directly ask Chris whether nibabel is moving soon
    
    - Dev/Stable doc PR resurrected : `#2605 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/2605>`_.
        - round of reviews, then merge

    - Sphinx copybutton : `#2838 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/2838>`_.
        - Eliz confirmed that prompts (`>>>`) not copied with sphinx-copybutton

- Possible enhancements

    - Plotly for plotting (see `#2793 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2793>`_).
        - green lights
        - add plotly and kaleido as optional dependencies

    - Type hinting
        - @Gael: Don't discourage it, but don't force contributors to add type hints. Do it especially when it's not costly.
        - @Taylor: Maybe look into sphinx extensions/settings to incorporate type hints into docstrings automatically.
        - TODO : Incorporate request for, but not enforcement of, type hints in contributing guidelines?

    - Follow-up on sprint discussions / suggested improvement
        - BIDS PR for GLMs: `#2715 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/2715>`_.
        - _pybids-light_ library for searching BIDS datasets with minimal overhead: work hasn't really started, but we have "plans":
            - `Repo <https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids-light>`_.
            - `HackMD <https://hackmd.io/vlC0NvzmSYKkVVNUXnKlHQ>`_.

        - Surfaces: deprecation PR + check with Chris for better integration within Nibabel...
    
    - Easier customization of nilearn plots: (i) adding references to useful objects (eg the colorbar axis) to the objects returned by nilearn plotting functions (eg BaseSlicer) (ii) adding an "advanced plotting" example. related: `#2761 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2761>`_.

    - moving average pca? See `#2662 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2662>`_.
        - To be discussed next meeting.

    - CircleCI artifacts : See `#2508 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2508>`_.
