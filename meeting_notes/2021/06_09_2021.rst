Note: Partial and shortened meeting due to labor day in the US and Canada.

- Feature requests

    - Smoothing function for surface based data
      See this Neurostars post https://neurostars.org/t/smoothing-surface-data/20159.
      Also related: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2747.

        -> Would be a nice addition but we need to find the right balance between complexity
           and simplicity for the implementation. Having a gaussian kernel width in mm as for
           `smoth_img` might be overly complex while simply averaging accross one hop neighbors
           in the mesh might lead to biases.
        -> A possible approach could be to rely on a weighted graph where the edge weights
           account for the lengths of the edges. From this graph, we could average accross
           all neighbors within some distance.
        -> @Gael: We need to look at fast methods to do that (based on the sparse adjacency
           matrix?)
        –> TODO: @NicolasGensollen will open an issue and explain problems and ideas to see
           what people think/propose.

- Current PRs

    - Plotly PR is quite large and would benefit from more reviews.
      See https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/2902.

        -> @NicolasGensollen simplified the PR recently to ease the review process.
        –> @NicolasGensollen: ask @jerome to see if Sebastien Urch could help with this.

    - Contributing docs PR had some recent activity. 
      See https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/2755.

        -> @Thomas: PR is ready for reviews. It is already a significant improvement
           and we can always iterate and improve in future PRs.
    
- Next release (0.8.1)

    - Aiming for mid-september (before team retreat would be cool).
        
        -> @NicolasGensollen: Created a milestone for it.
        -> Any PR and/or issue that need to be addressed?
           -> Mostly contributing PR and Plotly PR (see point above).
        -> @Gael: We can do a beta release before the team retreat and stable release
           after.

- Feedback on Office hours

    - We had 3 events so far but relatively little interest
      (2 persons for first one, and one person for last one)
      Are there things to improve communication-wise?

        -> People seem to be happy that these hours exist.
        -> Leave message on Discord general channel giving the next office hours.
           This will avoid hopefully people connecting and asking questions outside of
           hours.
        -> @Bertrand: The hours are also useful for us to work on Nilearn even though
           nobody shows up.

- Projects for the team retreat around Nilearn

    - @Alexis proposed to tackle the website design

        -> @Gael: This would be great but doesn't fit so well in the retreat projects
           spirit traditionally more data oriented.
        -> @Gael: Stephanie Noble can provide useful feedback for this.

- Team members

    - @Elizabeth mentioned last meeting that we should renew some of the core-dev team
      members since @Thomas and @Elizabteh will defend soon.

        --> @Gael: We should create more teams (triage, web, docs, core-devs...)
        --> @Gael: We should propose to bump people up more easily. Especially if they are
            motivated.
        --> @all: We should ask Alexis Thual and Hao Ting to join the core-dev team
