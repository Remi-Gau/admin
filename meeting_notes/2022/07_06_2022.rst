    - Combine nipy and contributor covenant?
    - open a PR with contributor covenant
- PR `2725 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/2725>`_ - consistent 1D inputs for `inverse_transform`
    - James identified the maskers that might return 3D outputs at the moment: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2726#issuecomment-794575338
    - We should review the maskers' inverse_transform and GLM outputs to see what produces 4D vs. 3D. Open an issue about it.
    - Consensus is that it would be reasonable to return 3D outputs when it is clear that there is no sample dimension (though there are probably backwards-incompatibility issues to deal with).
