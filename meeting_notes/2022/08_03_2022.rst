Open Issues and PRs
-------------------

- [#3167](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3167) 64-bit integer NIfTI images
    - Will require identifying where Nilearn writes out images and update to avoid creating int64. Wide (if not difficult) changes
- [#3158](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3158) Add note for new maskers module in examples
- [#3173](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3173) Allow not scaling background maps for surface plots (PR by A.Thual)
    - Still looking to add [flat maps](https://github.com/tknapen/tknapen.github.io/wiki/Pycortex-flattening) for different fsaverage resolutions. Alexis will contact Alex Huth to see whether he can provide existing maps
    - Open question as to how to update the API to better accomodate new parameters -- input welcome !
- [#3172](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3172) [ENH] Radiological view for cross-sectional MRI plotting
    - Provide guidance for new contributor as needed
- [#3122](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3122): Refactor documentation's theme
    - Changes to Sphinx-Gallery now merged (:tada:) to allow for hierarchical structure
    - Developers can divide docs to run through individual categories
    - Alexis will generate a live preview and then it can be divided among the developers, with Alexis' guidance on what should be evaluated
    - Could be good to have Yasmin's review on the doc structure as part of orienting to the library
- [#3085](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3085): correspondence between atlas region labels and NiftiLabelsMasker's output dimensions
    - Allow use of dictionary for labels. Deprecate use of list, but make the deprecation cycle very long since atlases use lists and users are used to lists.
    - Update atlases to have new dictionary label attribute. Don't replace the old one, just add a new one.
- [#3160](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3160)
    - Could merit a sooner patch release
