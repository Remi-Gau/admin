- News from the engineer job posting (Bertrand)
    - One candidate identified: Yasmin Mzayek ; itw by Nicolas pending ; might arrive on April 1st 
- Montreal job posting: JB will write posting
    - Jérôme and Elizabeth will edit the [existing posting](https://github.com/nilearn/admin/tree/main/proposals/engineer_2022) as a first pass
    - New overleaf document available here : https://www.overleaf.com/3674263154gyndmhhjpngh
- Organization for next meetings and office hours?
    - Nicolas: availability ?
        - Current time for office hours should work most of the times plus/minus a conflict from time to time
        - Current time for core-dev meetings works very poorly for me. Tuesday same time would be better
            - Update to Tuesday 6pm CET moving forward
    - Should someone else organize these? (Bertrand for the time being)
- hackathon in 2022 ? Coupled with OHBM ? Brainhack ? Any better suggestion ?
- OHBM Brainhack (16-18 June) will be hybrid, Nilearn would be a good project to submit with well-curated issues for beginners
- *Not* hold a Nilearn Dev Days this year and instead focus on the BrainHack
- Currently applying for funding for an in-person event in autumn in Montreal
    - Aim to have a Montreal-based developer before the event

Open Issues
-----------

- [#3132](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3132) :  Inconsistent behaviour of inverse_transform() in masker classes
    - Revive stale PR
- [#3122](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3122): Refactor documentation's theme
    - Pick up with Alexis directly
- [#3085](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3085): correspondance between atlas region labels and NiftiLabelsMasker's output dimensions
    - Allow use of dictionary for labels. Deprecate use of list, but make the deprecation cycle very long since atlases use lists and users are used to lists.
    - Update atlases to have new dictionary label attribute. Don't replace the old one, just add a new one.
- [#3058](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3058): Passing a 4D image to SecondLevelModel 
- [#3120](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3120): view_img always masks bg_img with MNI mask
    - threshold only when using Nilearn default option; never threshold image when user-provided

Other points
------------

- Jupyter book of advanced analyses?
    - Too much work for nilearn team, but maybe link to workshops/tutorials that use nilearn in documentation.
        - Would be useful to have this list even internally to create metrics for e.g. funding applications in the future
        - List of tutorials should document which versions of Nilearn they run under (and e.g. date of workshop)
    - More general question of how to handle compute-heavy examples
        - Could pitch developing these examples as a hackathon project ?
