General points
--------------

- Make decision about default parameters
    - See discussion in `#3519 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3519>`_.
        - Add them to the doc string, along with the type but not at the end of the doc string.
- Adding type annotations to Nilearn `#3568 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3568>`_.
    - See also `mypy PR #3569 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/3569>`_.
        - finish with reformatting before adding type annotations to the whole codebase
        - maybe not type the whole codebase
        - Revisit in a few months
- Refactoring unit tests
    - Discuss guidelines, see `comment <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/3572#issuecomment-1458028646>`_.
        - add doc strings to help give an overview of what / why / how things are tested
        - can be done iteratively
        - make sure new tests have explanation
    - Refactoring `nilearn._utils.data_gen`, see `comment <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/3572#issuecomment-1468620089>`_.
        - if the data gen is just used just for one module, keep it in that module
        - otherwise if the scope is bigger move it to  `nilearn._utils.data_gen`
- Updates about moving to `pyproject.toml`
    - Check in with Jerome when he's available.
    - Ask Chris why nibabel still has a requirements.txt file.
- Pre-release schedule
    - Consider `comment <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/3520#pullrequestreview-1315351292>`_.
    - NG: Proper semantic versioning would involve pushing enhancements/new features to a branch for the next minor release, and pushing bug fixes to a branch for maintaining the current minor release series. Each bug fix would result in a new patch release, and bug fixes would need to be ported to the next minor release's branch as well.
